            Tanjiro was born on a mountain as the eldest son of Kie and Tanjuro
            Kamado,<br>a family of charcoal sellers. After his five younger siblings were
            born,<br>he adopted the idea that as the oldest child,<br>he should be strong
            and endure any hardships for them.</p>

    <h1>Look how happy Tanjiro and his Family are!</h1>
